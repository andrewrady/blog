I am a software engineer in Boise Idaho who specializes in back end development. My primary tools have been dotnet and related tools, but I'm a Linux guy.
My blog is a place for me to share some of the personal projects and tools I have been working on lately. You can also checkout some of my work blogs for my other writing at [RIMdev.io](https://rimdev.io/author/andrew-rady)

## Favorite Topics

Recently my main focus has been working with Dotnet and Typescript but also enjoy working with Go.

The next technology I'm going to focus on is htmlx.
