My name is Andrew Rady and I've been a professional software developers for almost ten years.
Over those years I've worked on small to large teams creating solutions for companies to improve businesses. I enjoy writing code, but what drives me is solving real world problems the best way possible.
I love working with small to medium size teams with ttalented memebers who push each other to improve and create the best solutions.
