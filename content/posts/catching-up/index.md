## Catching Up

It's been a couple years since I started this blog and there hasn't been much progress. There is a couple different factors but the main one has been focus. I've been working Ritter Insurance Marketing since
2017. I started their a junior front end developer and in 2020 I moved over as a back end developer. Working primarily on back end services written in Dotnet. I started this blog a couple of years
ago to try write down my thoughts and some experiences, but obviously didn't keep up on that.

## Time As A Front-End Developer

The time I spent on the front end is where I learned the most. It's not just the technical stuff too - much is how to work in a software development team. A lot of this are the things you don't
get in school. Aspects like working with others, git, how to do good code reviews, meeting (everyone's favorite), and so much more. I also got my real first hand experience of how powerful JavaScript can be.
I worked with some great and extremely talented people and learned as much as possible. Framework of choice? Vue - I'll still stand pick Vue over React and Angular any day! I also picked on other important skills 
working with tools like webpack, vite, creating NPN packages, etc.

While working on the front-end team we were able to go to some amazing conferences

- 2017 VueConf in New Orleans
- 2018 VueConf in Tampa
- 2019 An Event Apart in Chicago
- 2020 VueConf in Austin

## Back-End Developer

Late 2020 I switch to our backend team. I was a little nervous about the choice for a couple of years. First, the front end team was a great group and I didn't want to "leave" them. Although we all work 
together I was worried about not being part of that group. Another was my ability to adapt and work with C# and Dotnet. It was a pretty big change going from JavaScript, a dynamic run time language to
a static precompiled language like C#. Overall it was a challenge and I learned a lot over the years - backend is a whole other beast. Here I mostly worked on micro-services that were restful
apis, but also got to work with other tools. Azure functions, Terraform, and our own developed bot that integrated with our deployment process. 

Some other cool conference 

- 2023 VSLive in Las Vegas

## What I'm Currently Doing

I'm still working as a back-end developer here at Ritter Insurance marketing. It has been a turbulent year as we've been assisting a sister team at Integrity, and looking to fully integrate here soon. 
Doing so has let me meet some great engineers over there and I'm looking forward to improving their systems. Seeing how other teams work and operate together has been super insightful.
I'm hopeful and excited to see what our teams can create together.
