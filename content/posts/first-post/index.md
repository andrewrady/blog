## Hello, World!

My name is Andrew Rady and I am currently a front end developer at Ritter Insurance Marketing working with Vue. I have been writing some blog post on our company blog at [rimdev.io](https://rimdev.io), but I wanted to start a personal one. On rimdev.io most of my articles are around vue since that is what I work on mostly, but I want to be able to share some of my experiences from side projects. I am person who doesn't write a lot so a personal goal of 2019 is to get better, and the best way to improve on something is to do it. 

## A little more about me

At work I am a front end developer and our main framework we support currently is Vue.js, but we also have other apps that are written in Angular. Most of my day is working in Javascript connecting to our apis and sometimes working in our back which is asp.net. One of our internal sites is written in Hugo and that was my first experience and I really liked it. So much that this site is written in Hugo. In my personal time I write software mostly for a local martial arts community. I run a studio which I wrote our internal software that is a rails api and a vue front end. I am also interested in Golang and wrote an api for a martial arts tournament schedule app. I have a few of these projects public on my [github](https://github.com/andrewrady?tab=repositories).

As I continue to work on these applications I will share my experiences, what I learned, how I fix problems, and more.
