## New Blog Post 

Its been a while since I last wrote a blog post here. I’ve wanted to start blogging again recently, but a lot has happened professionally and personal that has made it hard to getting back to it. More on that soon (All good)! I do plan on adding more content to this site to talk about side projects that I’ve been working on, and what I have learned from them.

### Switch Things Up

I’ll also will be migrating this site from Hugo to a jekyll site. I really like Golang and Hugo has been nice (we use it at work as well) but the community and features the jekyll has is just hard to beat. So stay tuned for a new design coming out soon! One of the main reasons that has pulled my focus away is I have switched roles at work as a back end developer. The last few months I have been getting up to speed with all of our applications and tooling which has been a great learning experience. We’ve also moved in the last few months, so when I thought I was going to have more time write some blog posts everything changed. Now that we’re settled in I have more time to work on some side projects and talk about some of the cool new technologies around them. I already have one started on my personal development environment and work flow so stay tuned for that! Yes I use vim, but not arch....
