This is one of the primary reason we as an industry do code reviews. It\u0026rsquo;s commonly called \u0026ldquo;code smell\u0026rdquo; - when we see a pattern or code usage that seems off. A few months ago I ran into one of these and wanted to highlight the usage, because I see even experienced software engineers fall into this common practice. I would like to highlight that while good practice in theory is commonly agreed upon, people get lost in the details. That\u0026rsquo;s ok as long\nSetup #Below is some example code I\u0026rsquo;ve see in different variations before. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly simple, all it does is gets a results of clients from a service and returns them. In this situation the method of the service takes in an optional parameter for a name\u0026hellip;yes I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this before. Once we get the results we\u0026rsquo;ll grab the first result and perform our business logic.\n*Please note: I\u0026rsquo;m making some of the common mistakes on purpose - I\u0026rsquo;m sure many of you can easily spot the mistakes before the next section :)\nvar results = await _clientService.GetClients(\u0026#34;josh\u0026#34;); //returns an IList\u0026lt;Client\u0026gt; models if (results != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; results.Any() == true) { var client = results.First(); //logic for client actions } Concerns #For those who work to keep their functions and methods simple there is one very glaring issue here. You have a method that is named one thing \u0026ldquo;GetClients\u0026rdquo; but has a parameter to get a single client. An important principle in code design is to have your methods or function do one thing, and this method is doing two things. Additionally, the naming convention implies that it\u0026rsquo;s doing one thing\u0026hellip; getting a list of clients because it\u0026rsquo;s plural. The issue is by having an optional parameter to get a single client the method is now doing two things. This is a classic code smell that a bare minimum that it\u0026rsquo;s time for a new method to get a single client.\nImprovements #Let\u0026rsquo;s take the code from above and make some small changes. There is three main things we can change based on creating a new method that just returns a single Client record.\nImprove the variable name as it reflects we\u0026rsquo;re getting a single client record. We can simplify our conditional to check if the results from the service is null. Since it\u0026rsquo;s a single record we don\u0026rsquo;t have to put it in a list. Anyone using the method doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know about an optional parameter to get s specific record. Single Record #var client = await _clientService.GetClient(\u0026#34;josh\u0026#34;); if (client == null) { //Error Handling } //logic for client record Multiple Records #var clients = await _clientService.GetClients(); if (client.Any() != true) { //Error Handling } //logic for client records Conclusion #It\u0026rsquo;s a valid concern when creating software not to bloat our application. I think that is the main system to this issue, but in our effort we make more work for ourselves. Situations like this is a common when trying to take our existing code base and make small changes to accomplish our goals. Keeping in mind basic principals like this will keep our code easier to understand and maintain over the life cycle.\n","date":"17 January 2025","permalink":"/posts/code-smells/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction #After coding for a while and making more mistakes then anyone wants to admit we as programmers tend to create a spiddy-sense of potential issues when doing code reviews.","title":"Code Smells"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/c%23/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"C#"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/dotnet/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dotnet"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Keeping data clean #One important aspect of managing data coming in through our api(s). Of course this is what data types and validation is for, but an easily overlooked aspect is handling strings and how we want store them in the database. It\u0026rsquo;s an easy oversight for anyone who hasn\u0026rsquo;t handle a large amount of data that us being used by multiple teams. An easy example is when two systems are comparing an email, but one system didn\u0026rsquo;t trim any white space and the user inputed their email with a space at the end. Sounds simple, right? It happens much more often then you\u0026rsquo;d think. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to add a lot of extra logic every time we compare strings to ensure there isn\u0026rsquo;t any white space unless abosultely nessicary. Which is why it\u0026rsquo;s important to add logic to handle this on every request - which is pretty easy with Donet.\nSolution #Linked is an example repo of a dotnet generated project for a webapi. You can generate it with the dotnet command dotnet new webapi -n API -controllers - I still use controllers for the most part. There\u0026rsquo;s a new post endpoint that takes in the standard WeatherForcast class that is included from the generated code and returns it back. This is helpful because it will show the results of the converter in swagger. We\u0026rsquo;ll create a new TrimStringConverter class that will handle all of the logic.\nusing System.Text.Json.Serialization; public class TrimStringConverter : JsonConverter\u0026lt;string?\u0026gt; { public override string? Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options) { return reader.GetString().Trim(); } public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, string? value, JsonSerializerOptions options) { writer.WriteStringValue(value); } } Most of the time you\u0026rsquo;ll see Converters used on the data annotion level which can be very granular, but we want to apply this to every property that is a string. We can do that by adding a few lines in the Program.cs file.\nbuilder.Services .AddControllers() .AddJsonOptions(option =\u0026gt; { option.JsonSerializerOptions.Converters.Add(new TrimStringConverter()); }); Now if we hit out endpoint http://localhost:5175/WeatherForecast with a payload with intended spaces in the properties that strings values it will return with those trimmed. This will happen before the values hit the controller. If you put a break point on the method name of the controller you can see the values update automatically.\nPayload #{ \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2024-12-27\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;temperatureC\u0026#34;: 29, \u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Warm \u0026#34; } Response #{ \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2024-12-27\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;temperatureC\u0026#34;: 29, \u0026#34;temperatureF\u0026#34;: 84, \u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Warm\u0026#34; } Improvements #While this is a good first step we an improve on this. Keeping strings clean and not having additional white space is important and we should also stop any blank string from being saved in columns. This can cause headaches for anyone who has to maintain the data later.\nusing System.Text.Json.Serialization; public class TrimStringConverter : JsonConverter\u0026lt;string?\u0026gt; { public override string? Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options) { var value = reader.GetString(); if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value)) { return null; } return value.Trim(); } public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, string? value, JsonSerializerOptions options) { writer.WriteStringValue(value); } } Conclusion #Something as simple handing empty strings on requests can easily overlooked, but can cause a lot of headaches down the road if not handled. With Dotnet\u0026rsquo;s middleware it makes it easy to take our custom converters and apply them to all requests before going to the controllers. There may be times where we only want to apply these with data annotations (which is a more common way to use converters) so applying them to the middlware is something you\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider if you want the behavior by default.\n","date":"26 December 2024","permalink":"/posts/trimming-string-api/","section":"Posts","summary":"Keeping data clean #One important aspect of managing data coming in through our api(s).","title":"Trimming Strings For Api Using Dotnet"},{"content":"Catching Up #It\u0026rsquo;s been a couple years since I started this blog and there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been much progress. There is a couple different factors but the main one has been focus. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working Ritter Insurance Marketing since 2017. I started their a junior front end developer and in 2020 I moved over as a back end developer. Working primarily on back end services written in Dotnet. I started this blog a couple of years ago to try write down my thoughts and some experiences, but obviously didn\u0026rsquo;t keep up on that.\nTime As A Front-End Developer #The time I spent on the front end is where I learned the most. It\u0026rsquo;s not just the technical stuff too - much is how to work in a software development team. A lot of this are the things you don\u0026rsquo;t get in school. Aspects like working with others, git, how to do good code reviews, meeting (everyone\u0026rsquo;s favorite), and so much more. I also got my real first hand experience of how powerful JavaScript can be. I worked with some great and extremely talented people and learned as much as possible. Framework of choice? Vue - I\u0026rsquo;ll still stand pick Vue over React and Angular any day! I also picked on other important skills working with tools like webpack, vite, creating NPN packages, etc.\nWhile working on the front-end team we were able to go to some amazing conferences\n2017 VueConf in New Orleans 2018 VueConf in Tampa 2019 An Event Apart in Chicago 2020 VueConf in Austin Back-End Developer #Late 2020 I switch to our backend team. I was a little nervous about the choice for a couple of years. First, the front end team was a great group and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to \u0026ldquo;leave\u0026rdquo; them. Although we all work together I was worried about not being part of that group. Another was my ability to adapt and work with C# and Dotnet. It was a pretty big change going from JavaScript, a dynamic run time language to a static precompiled language like C#. Overall it was a challenge and I learned a lot over the years - backend is a whole other beast. Here I mostly worked on micro-services that were restful apis, but also got to work with other tools. Azure functions, Terraform, and our own developed bot that integrated with our deployment process.\nSome other cool conference\n2023 VSLive in Las Vegas What I\u0026rsquo;m Currently Doing #I\u0026rsquo;m still working as a back-end developer here at Ritter Insurance marketing. It has been a turbulent year as we\u0026rsquo;ve been assisting a sister team at Integrity, and looking to fully integrate here soon. Doing so has let me meet some great engineers over there and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to improving their systems. Seeing how other teams work and operate together has been super insightful. I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful and excited to see what our teams can create together.\n","date":"8 December 2024","permalink":"/posts/catching-up/","section":"Posts","summary":"Catching Up #It\u0026rsquo;s been a couple years since I started this blog and there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been much progress.","title":"Catching Up"},{"content":"My Experience Building A Rails App As A Dotnet Developer #I use to write a lot of rails applications when I was newer as a developer. Fast forward almost a decade later with professional experience, I thought I would look into rails again. I\u0026rsquo;ve slightly followed the progression of rails over the years and agree with some points of DDH\u0026rsquo;s. Main about JavaScript and how it\u0026rsquo;s become overly complex for web apps. Although, I personally love static type languages. I know shocker - coming from a dotnet developer.\nGoal #I wanted to create a basic crud application that mimicked an existing application I\u0026rsquo;ve built in dotnet. This way I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about what I was making..and be able to focus more on ruby and rails. It was a pretty simple mvc product that focused on three main points.\nStandard CRUD workflow for a handful on models Authentication Background jobs Of course, there was more minor details on the architecture but I want to focus on more of my experience writing the application\nWhat I liked #The last time I wrote a Rails application in any real fashion has to be close to eight years. A lot has changed in the web world since then! The main point I really liked was just how easy it was to get started. I remembered many of the cli commands to generate models and controllers. That is a huge because anyone who works with these tools know how many there are! Just that alone I was able to scaffold out a large amount very quickly. Another great thing was Rails documentation. When I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to setup something like nested forms for child models I was able to \u0026ldquo;easily\u0026rdquo; find how to do it directly on their documentation site. I quotes because easy can be relative and while it was super convenient once I found it - it took me some research to get there. Seriously, Rails documentation is great and can easily be navigated to find great gems (see what I did there)! Lastly, the plugin ecosystem is great. I was able to easily install the few gems I needed to get up and running. Since the app was pretty slim I really only need devise for authentication and sidekiq for sidejobs. I\u0026rsquo;m sure if this need to be put into production things would become more complex. For example, devise is a great way to start authentication but it would probably be worth integrating it with OAuth as well.\nWhat I didn\u0026rsquo;t like #Rails is known for convention over configuration and overall I think that is great perspective. The issue is when you\u0026rsquo;re not in a specific domain it can be hard to know how it should be done. I ran into this situation a h handful of times. Figuring out nested attributes and how to pass them into the parent controller was \u0026ldquo;annoying\u0026rdquo; at first, but once I knew how Rails wanted it setup it was simple. Another major point was some of the helpers for forms. Nested forms and how to get them setup was enough to make me second guess my entire decision. I was almost to the point of just manually writing out the forms in html. Lucky after some research on the docs I was able to figure it out. This one is a personal problem\u0026hellip;I missed having static types. There was more then once dealing with fairly complex logic that I messed up types and had to step through the logs to see what was going on.\nConclusion #Ruby on Rails gets a lot of flack from the community. Most of the criticism are unjust and blown way out of proportion in my opinion. Using the correct tool for the requirements and the developer behind the tool is just, if not more important. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on technologies that you would expect to be more performance based on the stack, but the choices of prior developers were not great. At the end of the day most web applications are just basic CRUD applications with business logic. Sure there are out lairs that need a higher performance stack or language like Go or Rust. Most of my personal projects that are in use are in either Dotnet or Go but if I find a small fit for a Rails application I would consider adding it to my small ecosystem.\n","date":"4 December 2024","permalink":"/posts/rails-experience/","section":"Posts","summary":"My Experience Building A Rails App As A Dotnet Developer #I use to write a lot of rails applications when I was newer as a developer.","title":"Rails Experience"},{"content":"Connecting your Rails application to a database #Rails default setup uses sqlite which is a great way to get starting building applications, but at some point we will need to connect to a real database.

It\u0026rsquo;s just a simple crud application that displays martial arts rings at tournaments. While I could write the entire website with Go I opted in to make an api. The reason is I want to make a React site and mobile apps made with React Native. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty simple rest API that needed to connect to a database. I used a few packages to make development practical\nMux (for route handling) gorm (an orm for golang to interface with databases) jwt-go [to help create jwt for Auth] bcrypt (to hash passwords) Things I have learned #importing packages are fairly similar to other languages as python.

For this project I ended up using dep More on this in another post.\nAnother thing I learned from this project is export functions and how to use them in different files. This project is pretty small so the main.go handles all of the routing, and the functions that handle all of the logic is broken into different files. For example the /ring route returns all of the active rings. The function that handles communication to the database and return the values in json is in the rings.go file. For the main.go to be able to use the AllRings function all we need to do is capitalize the function. Any function in that file that isn\u0026rsquo;t capitalized can only be used within that file. Personally I like this simple practice. I have forgot to export a function in larger files and took sime valuable time debugging to figure out I forgot this.\nWrap up #The project is hosted in github and still needs some work.

I am person who doesn\u0026rsquo;t write a lot so a personal goal of 2019 is to get better, and the best way to improve on something is to do it.\nA little more about me #At work I am a front end developer and our main framework we support currently is Vue.js, but we also have other apps that are written in Angular. Most of my day is working in Javascript connecting to our apis and sometimes working in our back which is asp.net. One of our internal sites is written in Hugo and that was my first experience and I really liked it. So much that this site is written in Hugo. In my personal time I write software mostly for a local martial arts community. I run a studio which I wrote our internal software that is a rails api and a vue front end. I am also interested in Golang and wrote an api for a martial arts tournament schedule app. I have a few of these projects public on my github.\nAs I continue to work on these applications I will share my experiences, what I learned, how I fix problems, and more.\n","date":"3 February 2019","permalink":"/posts/first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hello, World!","title":"First Post"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/javascript/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Javascript"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/vue.js/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vue.js"},{"content":"I am a software engineer in Boise Idaho who specializes in back end development.
